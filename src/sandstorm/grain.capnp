#
# TODO(cleanup):  Put in separate file?  Note that PowerboxCapability must be declared before
#   UiView due to a bug in Cap'n Proto requiring superclasses to be declared before subclasses.
#
# The powerbox is part of the Sandstorm UI which allows users to connect applications to each
# other.  First, one application must publish a PowerboxCapability to the powerbox via
# `SandstormApi.publish()`.  Then, a second application may request a capability from the powerbox
# via `SessionContext.request()`.  The user is presented with a list of capabilities from the
# powerbox which match the requesting application's query.  The user may select one, which will
# then be returned to the requesting app.
#
# Another way to connect apps is via actions.  One application may declare that it can implement
# some action on any capability matching a particular query.  Another application may later use
# SessionContext.offer() to offer a specific capability to the current user.  The user will be
# presented with a list of actions that make sense for that capability and may select one.  (This
# is much like Android intents.)

interface PowerboxCapability extends(Persistent) {

  #

  # TODO(someday):  Let the app publish a picker UI which can be embedded in the powerbox.  For
  #   example, a music library may want to make each track in the library available via the

  # unusual.  Usually, you want to define actions in the application's manifest; such actions will

  shareCap @2 (cap :PowerboxCapability) -> (sharedCap :PowerboxCapability, link :SharingLink);

  # share is automatically revoked if `link` is discarded.  If `cap` is persistable, then both
  # `sharedCap` and `link` also are.
  #
  # This method is intended to be used by programs that acutally implement a communications link
  # over which a capability could be sent from one user to another.  For example, a chat app would
  # use this to prepare a capability to be embedded into a message.  In these cases, capabilities
  # may be shared without going through the system sharing UI, and therefore the application must
  # set up the sharing link itself.
  #
  # In general, you should NOT call this on a capability that you will then pass to
  # `SessionContext.offer()`.

  deleted @6 (ref :AppSturdyRef);

interface UiView extends(PowerboxCapability) {
  # Implements a user interface with which a user can interact with the grain.  We call this a
  # "view" because a single grain may actually have multiple "views" that provide different
  # functionality or represent multiple logical objects in the same physical grain.
  #
  # When an application starts up, it must export an instance of UiView as its starting
  # capability on the Cap'n Proto two-party connection.  This represents the grain's main view and
  # is what the user will see when they open the grain.
  #
  # It is possible for a grain to export additional views via the usual powerbox mechanisms.  For
  # instance, a spreadsheet app might let the user create a "view" of a few cells of the
  # spreadsheet, allowing them to share those cells to another user without sharing the entire
  # sheet.  To accomplish this, the app would create an alternate UserInterface object that
  # implements an interface just to those cells, and then would use `UiSession.offer()` to offer
  # this object to the user.  The user could then choose to open it, share it, save it for later,
  # etc.

  getViewInfo @0 () -> ViewInfo;
  # Get metadata about the view, especially relating to sharing.

  struct ViewInfo {
    permissions @0 :List(PermissionDef);
    # List of permission bits which apply to this view.  Permissions typically include things like
    # "read" and "write".  When sharing a view, the sending user may select a set of permissions to
    # grant to the receiving user, and may modify this set later on.  When a new user interface
    # session is initiated, the platform indicates which permissions the user currently has.
    #
    # The grain's owner always has all permissions.
    #
    # It is important that new versions of the app only add new permissions, never remove existing
    # ones, since permission IDs are indexes into the list and persist through upgrades.
    #
    # In a true capability system, permissions would normally be implemented by wrapping the main
    # view in filters that prohibit disallowed actions.  For example, to give a user read-only
    # access to a grain, you might wrap its UiView in a wrapper that checks all incoming requests
    # and disallows the ones that would modify the content.  However, this approach does not work
    # terribly well for UiView for a few reasons:
    #
    # - For complex UIs, HTTP is often the wrong level of abstraction for this kind of filtering.
    #   It _may_ work for modern apps that push all UI logic into static client-side Javascript and
    #   only serve RPCs over dynamic HTTP, but it won't work well for many legacy apps, and we want
    #   to be able to port some of those apps to Sandstorm.
    #
    # - If a UiView is reshared several times, each time adding a new filtering wrapper, then
    #   requests could get slow as they have to pass through all the separate filters.  This would
    #   be especially bad if some of the filters live in other grains, as those grains would have
    #   to spin up whenever the resulting view is used.
    #
    # - Compared to computers, humans are relatively less likely to be vulnerable to confused
    #   deputy attacks and relatively more likely to be confused by the concept of having multiple
    #   capabilities to the same object that provide different access levels.  For example, say
    #   Alice and Bob both share the same document to Carol, but Alice only grants read access
    #   while Bob gives read/write.  Carol should only see one instance of the document in her
    #   grain list and she should see the read/write interface when she opens it.  But this instance
    #   isn't simply the one she got from Bob -- if Bob revokes his share but Alice continues to
    #   share read rights, Carol should now see the read-only interface when she opens the same
    #   grain.
    #
    # To solve all three problems, we have permission bits that are processed when creating a new
    # session.  Instead of filtering individual requests, wrappers of UiView only need to filter
    # calls to `newSession()` in order to restrict the permission set as appropriate.  Once a
    # session is thus created, it represents a direct link to the target grain.  Also, the platform
    # can implement special handling of sharing and permission bits that allow it to recognize when
    # two UiViews are really the same view with different permissions applied, and can then combine
    # them in the UI as appropriate.
    #
    # It is actually entirely possible to implement a traditional filtering membrane around a
    # UiView, perhaps to implement a kind of access that can't be expressed using the permission
    # bits defined by the app.  But doing so will be awkward, slow, and confusing for all the
    # reasons listed above.

    roles @1 :List(RoleDef);
    # Choosing individual permissions is not very intuitive for most users.  Therefore, the sharing
    # interface prefers to offer the user a list of "roles" to assign to each recipient.  For
    # example, a document might have roles like "editor" and "viewer".  Each role corresponds to
    # some list of permissions.  The application may define a set of roles to offer via this list.
    #
    # In addition to the roles in this list, the sharing interface will always offer a "full access"
    # or "same as me" option.  So, it only makes sense to define roles that represent less than
    # "full access", and leaving the role list entirely empty is reasonable if there are no such
    # restrictions to offer.
    #
    # It is important that new versions of the app only add new roles, never remove existing ones,
    # since role IDs are indexes into the list and persist through upgrades.

    deniedPermissions @2 :PermissionSet;
    # Set of permissions which will be removed from the permission set when creating a new session
    # though this object.  This set should be empty for the grain's main UiView, but when that view
    # is shared with less than full access, recipients will get a proxy UiView which has a non-empty
    # `deniedPermissions` set.
    #
    # It is not the caller's responsibility to enforce this set.  It is provided mainly so that the
    # sharing UI can avoid offering options to the user that don't make sense.  For instance, if
    # Alice has read-only access to a document and wishes to share the document to Bob, the sharing
    # UI should not offer Alice the ability to share write access, because she doesn't have it in
    # the first place.  The sharing UI figures out what Alice has by examining `deniedPermissions`.

  # Start a new user interface session.  This happens when a user first opens the view, or when

  #
  # `sessionParams` is a struct whose type is specified by the session type.  By convention, this

  # Name by which to identify this user within the user interface.  For example, if two users are
  # editing a document simultaneously, the application may display each user's cursor position to

  # name and a user's display name could change.

  permissions @1 :PermissionSet;
  # Set of permissions which this user has.  The exact set might not correspond directly to any
  # particular role for a number of reasons:
  # - The sharer may have toggled individual permissions through the advanced settings.
  # - If two different users share different roles to a third user, and neither of the roles is a
  #   strict superset of the other, the user gets the union of the two permissions.
  # - If Alice shares role A to Bob, and Bob further delegates role B to Carol, then Carol's
  #   permissions are the intersection of those granted by roles A and B.
  #
  # That said, some combinations of permissions may not make sense.  For example, a document editor
  # probably has no reasonable way to implement write permission without read permission.  It is up
  # to the application to decide what to do in this case, but simply ignoring the nonsensical
  # permissions is often a fine strategy.
  #
  # If the user's permissions are reduced while the session is opened, the session will be closed
  # by the platform and the user forced to start a new one.  If the user's permissions are increased
  # while the session is opened, the system will prompt them to start a new session to use the new

  #   well wipe their storage and never notify us), so at best we could do "best effort"
  #   notification. But there's a more subtle problem: the app would have to refcount save()s
  #   and delete()s and only delete the underlying object when all references are gone. Apps could
  #   easily get this wrong and just go ahead and delete the object the first time they receive a
  #   delete(), and this will probably pass testing because they won't test the case where the
  #   object has been saved twice. We can't have the supervisor do the refcounting for us because
  #   the supervisor does not know about intra-app saves, which by the way is another thing that
  #   apps may easily fail to test.
  #
  #   Ultimately I think the right thing here is for SturdyRefs always to be thought of as "weak"
  #   pointers. They point to some object that belongs to the grain, which in turn belongs to some
  #   user. The object should not expect to know whether it is currently in-use; it's up to the
  #   user to delete it if they so choose.
